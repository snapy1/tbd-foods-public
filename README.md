What is TBD Foods? TBD Foods is an app that I created to help those to try to eat healthy or follow a strict diet more easily. The source of inspiration for this app is from my dad who was recently diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic. I got extremely emotional seeing how sad and frustrated he was getting when trying to find food that fit his newly strict diet, because of this both his mental and physical health were on decline. So, I wanted to design something that helps him (and other people too of course!).

This is when the idea for TBD Foods came in. The idea was simple, and it relies on two things. The first idea is that it takes information about the user (e.g., their age, weight, any health issues). And the second idea is that it takes a barcode of the food product. With the help of AI, it takes both of these sources of information and uses that to determine a score for the corresponding food in relation to the information you provide.

What type of AI does it use? Well, for right now I am restricted to using OpenAI's system for all of the information generation. The long-term goal is to create my own LLM, but that will come in due time.

Unfortunately, because of the expensive and heavily implemented API calls, this app could not be free (although it is a dream of mine to make it free, because I strongly feel that helping other people live healthier should not cost money), but I do try to make it as reasonable as possible while not burning a hole in anyone's pocket and still being able to make ends meet on my end.

TBD Foods is still in early development so there are undoubtedly issues and many features that I'm hoping to implement.
